{\bf Chapter 6.4}\hspace{2ex}The Maxwell speed distribution
\newline
\begin{defi}
The Maxwell speed distribution is the distribution of the speed of a gas molecule with temperature $T$. The area $D(v)\cdot dv$ is the probability for the gas molecule to be between $v$ and $v+dv$. 
\[\mathcal{D}(v)=\Big(\dfrac{m}{2\pi kT}\Big)^{3/2}\cdot 4\pi v ^2\cdot \exp \Big(-\dfrac{mv ^2}{2kT}\Big)\]
\end{defi}
\vspace{2ex}
\begin{proof}
As the distribution should be proportional to the probability of a molecule to have a velocity of ${\bf v}$ times the number of vectors ${\bf v}$ corresponding to the speed $v$, we have
\[\mathcal{D}(v)=c\cdot 4\pi v^2\cdot \exp \Big(-\dfrac{mv ^2}{2kT}\Big)\]
since the total probabilty should be $1$, we find the constant to be
\[c=\Big(\dfrac{m}{2\pi kT}\Big)^{3/2}\]
The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is therefore given as
\[\mathcal{D}(v)=\Big(\dfrac{m}{2\pi kT}\Big)^{3/2}\cdot 4\pi v ^2\cdot \exp \Big(-\dfrac{mv ^2}{2kT}\Big)\]
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
The most probable speed is given as
\[v_{max}=\sqrt{\dfrac{2kT}{m}}\]
The average speed is given as
\[\bar{v}=\sqrt{\dfrac{8kT}{m\pi }}\]
The root-mean-square speed is given as
\[v_{rms}=\sqrt{\dfrac{3kT}{m}}\]
\end{cor}
