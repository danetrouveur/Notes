\section{Lecture 17 (May 12th)}
\begin{thm}
(Pressure, chemical potential, and entropy in terms of $F$ and $G$) Notice that from the thermodynamic identity $dU=T\,dS-P\,dV+\mu \,dN$
\begin{align*}
F=&U-TS\\
dF=&dU-T\,dS-S\,dT\\
=&(T\,dS-P\,dV+\mu\,dN)-T\,dS-S\,dT\\
=&-P\,dV+\mu\,dN-S\,dT
\end{align*}
as $F=F(T,V,N)$. We conclude that
\[P=-\Big(\dfrac{\partial F}{\partial V} \Big)_{T,N}\quad \mu =\Big(\dfrac{\partial F}{\partial N} \Big)_{T,V}\quad S=-\Big(\dfrac{\partial F}{\partial T} \Big)_{V,N}\]
By a similar argument, we also have $G=G(T,P,N)$ and
\[S=-\Big(\dfrac{\partial G}{\partial T} \Big)_{P,N}\quad V=\Big(\dfrac{\partial G}{\partial P} \Big)_{T,N}\quad \mu =\Big(\dfrac{\partial G}{\partial N} \Big)_{T,P}\]
\end{thm}
