\begin{rmk}
(Liquefaction of gases) If you want to make something really cold, you normally don't just stick it into a refrigerator â€“ instead you put it on dry ice, immerse it in liquid nitrogen, or even liquid helium. These gases are liquefied in the first place using a throttling process.

\begin{defi}
(Free energies) There is Helmholtz free energy $F$ and Gibbs free energy $G$.
\[\begin{cases}
F=U-TS\\
G=H-TS=U+PV-TS
\end{cases}\]
At constant $T$, we can think of these energies as quantities that are minimised as $\Delta V=0$ and $\Delta P=0$ respectively.

\begin{proof}
At constant $T$,
\[\Delta F=\Delta U-T\Delta S=Q+W-T\Delta S\]
Since $T\Delta S\geq Q$, we have $\Delta F\leq W$. On the other hand,
\[\Delta G=\Delta U-T\Delta S+P\Delta V=Q+W-T\Delta S+P\Delta V\]
Since $T\Delta S\geq Q$, we have $\Delta G\leq W$. Therefore, in each case, we see the difference in free energies to be less than the work done by an external system.
