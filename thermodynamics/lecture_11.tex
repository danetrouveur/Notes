\begin{rmk}
Negative temperatures can occur only for a system whose total energy is limited, so that the multiplicity decreases as the maximum allowed energy is approached. Though negative temperatures seems to be unusual, it tells that entropy is the more fundamental quantity, governed by the second law of thermodynamics. Temperature is less fundamental. It is merely a characterisation of a system's ``willingness" to give up energy, that is, of the relationship between its energy and entropy.
